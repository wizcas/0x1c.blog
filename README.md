# 0x1C.dev Blog

This is the implementation of my [blog](https://0x1c.dev). 

Client: [Remix](https://remix.run)
Server: [Strapi](https://strapi.io)

## Development

- Run `yarn install` in the root directory
- Run `yarn dev:client` to launch the client development environment
- Run `yarn dev:server` to launch the server development environment
- Read the READMEs in the client and server directories respectively to learn more
- If a warning is shown when starting the client environment about the inconsistent binaries, run this command to fix it:
  ```shell
  npm config set scripts-prepend-node-path true
  ```
